# ðŸ’» Temitope O. Adegoke

Hi there, I'm a proactive Software Engineer with proven professional years of experience building digital solutions across various industries.

Teaching and peer programming are norms for me as I love collaborating with teammates, learning from others, and impacting my knowledge in any way I can, it's about growing together.

Outside all this, you'd probably find me on the internet checking out new things, or another route to getting this done, and in several cases just playing games.
